# Optimized_Loan_Acceptance_Prediction_using_ML
Machine Learning project for Loan Acceptance prediction with OneAPI optimization
Introduction:
In today's dynamic financial landscape, the ability to predict customer behavior plays a crucial role in making informed decisions. Our machine learning project, "Predicting Loan Acceptance," delves into the realm of consumer banking, aiming to forecast whether a customer is likely to accept a loan offer based on various key features.

# Objectives:

  The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of a customer accepting a loan. By understanding the patterns and relationships within the data, our model strives to provide valuable insights for financial institutions seeking to optimize their lending strategies.KNN and Logistic Regression Machine Learning models are uses and KNN produced the higher Accuracy.

# **oneAPI:**

  The oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit [1] is implemented using the oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL), a powerful machine learning library that helps speed up big data analysis. oneDAL is an extension of Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL) and is a part of oneAPI. oneAPI is a cross-industry, open, standards-based unified programming model that delivers a common developer experience across accelerator architectures.
  
# **oneAPI Optimization:**

  In our relentless pursuit of refining the loan acceptance prediction model, we've seamlessly integrated the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm using the oneAPI oneDAL —an extension of the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (DAAL). This strategic incorporation of oneDAL elevates the performance of our model, harnessing the power of accelerated computations for efficient kNN operations. By leveraging oneAPI oneDAL, our model not only benefits from enhanced parallel processing capabilities but also signifies our commitment to utilizing cutting-edge technologies for optimal predictive accuracy in the domain of loan acceptance prediction. This integration exemplifies our dedication to staying at the forefront of advancements in data analytics and ensuring that our model operates efficiently and effectively in real-world scenarios.
